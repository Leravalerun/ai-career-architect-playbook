### The “Frontier Firm” — Humans + Agents as Teams

**Observation:**  
38% of global executives are rebuilding workflows around AI,  
and 42% are developing multi-agent systems to collaborate with human teams (Microsoft WorkLab, 2025).

**Hypothesis:**  
The future workplace will consist of mixed teams: human intuition + AI precision.  
Designing collaboration protocols, rituals, and roles between humans and agents becomes a new discipline.
