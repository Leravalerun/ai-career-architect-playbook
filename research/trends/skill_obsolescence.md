**Observation:**  
Half of current work skills will change within 3 years (Deloitte Human Capital Trends, 2025).  
Job titles lose relevance faster than educational systems can adapt.

**Hypothesis:**  
Careers are becoming modular — people will update their “skill stack” like software.  
The new resume is a **living graph** of tasks, not degrees.
