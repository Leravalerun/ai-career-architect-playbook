### Shadow AI — Employee-Driven Adoption

**Observation:**  
71% of employees use unapproved AI tools at work (Microsoft, 2025).  
This grassroots adoption accelerates innovation but erodes trust and governance.

**Hypothesis:**  
Organizations must move from controlling AI usage to **designing psychological safety around it**.  
“AI Career Architects” can bridge the gap between experimentation and compliance.
